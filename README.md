# evaluation-hub
This is a static copy of the HTML code (produced in the browser) of the website evalutionhub.nz that was originally written in SilverStripe 4 by Dr.Abdul Wahid. SilverStripe 4 is a PHP framework that generates HTML. For this reason, future development to add a back-end (in SilverStripe as desired by the government) should not use this code but instead use the original SilverStripe codebase.

HTTrack Website Copier/3.x is a one click tool that "crawls" an existing site and copying the surface HTML code and resources into an automatically generated folder structure. It is not a perfect tool and can produce useless files and is the reason that every page is an index.html file inside a folder corresponding to each page name. PLEASE NOTE: Only the file paths ending in "index.html" are used in the static site. For example, you may see there are files such as "evaluative-thinking.html" which look like they do something but "evaluative-thinking/index.html" is the actual file that runs on the static site. The reason for this double up is that HTTrack Website Copier/3.x also automatically hosts the website and produces duplicate files to compare for updating purposes. These are redundant
