# evaluation-hub
This is a static copy of the HTML code (produced in the browser) of the website "evaluationhub.nz" that was originally written in SilverStripe 4 by Dr.Abdul Wahid. SilverStripe 4 is a PHP framework that generates HTML. For this reason, future development to add a back-end (in SilverStripe as desired by the government) should not use this code but instead use the original SilverStripe codebase. This codebase can be found at 'X:\Analytics and Insights\34 - Evaluation Strategy\Evaluation Hub Website\Evaluation Hub website back-up\EvaluationHub_source_code'.

## HTTrack Website Copier/3.x
You may see the following HTML comment in the code: "Mirrored from evaluationhub.nz/ by HTTrack Website Copier/3.x [XR&CO'2014], Thu, 29 Aug 2019 21:38:47 GMT".

HTTrack Website Copier/3.x is a one click tool that "crawls" an existing site and copying the surface HTML code and resources into an automatically generated folder structure. It is not a perfect tool and can produce duplicated files and initially creates an index.html file for every page, inside a folder corresponding to each page name. PLEASE NOTE: refactoring has taken place to remove the /index.html suffix (except in the case of the index.html file itself), remove unnecessary duplicated files nested in unnecessary folders to streamline the project structure. 

## Refactoring
The project has been refactored but you will note code has not been reused effectively e.g. every file contains a navbar and footer. This has not been refactored due to the time involved and the differences in links due to folder structure of files that are nested. This is a by-product of the crawling of the original site in which SilverStripe dynamically generates the html for the navbar and footer etc. Also, when this static site becomes an official government website, the code base will need to be SilverStripe and given the correct structure to the standards and satisfaction of the Web Services government department. The orginal code base in SilverStripe by Dr. Abdul Wahid is unsurprisingly already known to not meet this standard. 

Lastly, in the static site there have been several improvements to the grammar and spelling of the content. Every HTML comment regarding a change made by Bevan Shaw in the static site code  has the prefix + structure: "Bevan DD/MM/YY: Reason a change was made". 
These changes included finding and removing duplicate paragraphs, standarising fonts, fixing broken links, and changes such as "Lean More" becoming "Learn More". Because Bevan Shaw encountered problems with playing the embedded videos due to privacy settings on Vimeo for the video resources produced by the team on the "Home" page and "Theory of Change" page, the decision was made to place the videos as unlisted videos on Youtube instead.

## Hosting, YouTube Resources and Domain
Currently the static site "evaluationhub.org.nz" is hosted as GitHub pages from Simon Williamson's GitHub account. The YouTube resources are embedded from Simon Williamson's YouTube account. The domain "evaluationhub.org.nz" is owned by Simon Williamson and the provider is Go Daddy "nz.godaddy.com".
